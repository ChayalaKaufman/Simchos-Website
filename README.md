This website is here to help you manage your neighborhood simchos.
Instead of running around every time there is a kiddush to collect money from each neighbor for a gift, everyone can simply give deposits
and you keep a record of it.
Then, every time there is a simcha, whoever wants to be included can give you a call and tell you how much to give for them.
In this project, there is a page of simchos and a page of contributors.
For each simcha, you can click on contributions, and view and update all the contributions.
For each contributor, you can make deposits, view their history, and make contributions.
